                Hi! I'm Juan Zurita, a Computer Science student at BYU-Idaho. I was born in Bolivia ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡´, but when I was 4 years old, my family moved to Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, where I grew up and have lived most of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm passionate about technology and AI, and I love creating anything that can have a real impact in the world. I enjoy learning a broad range of topics and I'm continuously looking for new challenges.
                I built this static vanilla JavaScript website to host my resume and showcase my design abilities. I hope you enjoy it!
